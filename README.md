## Summary 
- The analysis shows that bike-sharing is more popular in the male population. It also shows that the most bikes checked out have  trip duration for at least 5 minutes for all users. If we break this down by gender, we can see that the data changes. The most number of bikes checkout by males has a tripduration of 5 minutes. The most number of bikes checkout out by fmeales is 8 minutes. For gender unknown, the most of bikes checked out has an tripduration of about 11 minutes. The most popular weekday for trips for all users was found to be Thursday around 5 and 6 pm. If we break this down by Gender, we can see that males made most of these trips as wells as more trips during the week. Finally we are also able to see that more trips are taken by subscribers, and more males subcribe than female and unknown, and the least number of rides occur on Sunday. 

- Two additional visualizations that are suggested for future analizations would be battery length of bikes and most popular area for bikes.
